## Data Mining the Water Table: Project Overview
### [GitHub Project Page](https://github.com/flavioloss/waterpump_challenge/blob/main/)
### This project is from the Machine Learning challenge hosted on Driven Data. You can find the challenge [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/). 
I ranked 903 out of 13,000 competitors.


#### What was developed:
- Estimator: I developed a multi-class classification model to predict the functionality of water pumps. The model achieved an accuracy score of 82.15%.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: I performed a thorough analysis of the data, visualizing distributions, relationships, and correlations between variables.
- Feature Engineering and Importance: Using random forest, I determined the importance of each feature for the estimator. I also engineered features to handle non-numerical data and utilized spatial features such as latitude and longitude.
- Multiple models: I experimented with various models, including Random Forests, Neural Networks, and CatBoost. CatBoost yielded the best accuracy score.

#### After modeling, I built a deployable application to identify the category of water pumps on a map visualization of Tanzania. I used the Plotly Python library for this purpose.
#### To build and maintain the application online, I utilized Streamlit and Streamlit Cloud.
